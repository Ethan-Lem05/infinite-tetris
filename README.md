# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Game

python main.py
```

## Development Notes

A brain-rot version of Tetris that does not speed up. Made quickly so that I can play Tetris casually.
The code in `main.py` is intentionally compact and designed for learning and experimentation. Feel free to fork the project and add your own twists.
